Provided a website-master template package, a <a href="https://dalenadangyu.github.io/ITEC4020A-Fall2024-Assignment/">portfolio landing page</a> was quickly put together as an introduction to the student collaborators that worked on the assignment.  I worked on the assignment alone, thus only one student name has been provided in the portfolio landing page and on this evaluation research page.

Provided (3) three .csv files, each preloaded with multiple-choice questions surveying particular topics with the answer options as well as a field containing the correct answer option.  An unstructured database was created using MongoDB which was created as 'ChatGPT_Evaluation'.  The (3) three .csv files were uploaded into separate collections: 'Computer_Security', 'History', and 'Social_Science'.
