          ChatGPT's responses to users' inquiries inputted demonstrates a high level of sophistication in the 
          machine learning's capacity to comprehend and exchange communication fluidly.  However, the responses 
          (or answers) provided from ChatGPT and other machine learning language engines have been observed to be 
          sometimes inaccurate.  The ChatGPT Efficiency Evaluation Research conducted evaluates the accuracy of 
          ChatGPT's responses to questions across the following topic domains: Computer Security, History, and 
          Social Science.

    <h3>Research Approach</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Provided a website-master template package, a 
      <a href="https://dalenadangyu.github.io/ITEC4020A-Fall2024-Assignment/" target="_blank">portfolio 
        landing page</a> was quickly put together as an introduction to the student collaborators that 
        worked on the assignment.  I, Dalena Dang, worked on the assignment alone, thus only one student 
        name has been provided in the portfolio landing page and on this evaluation research page.

        <h4>The Setup: MongoDB & Mongoose</h4>
        Provided <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/165Os_GXfkMv7N1pGzxDcrPh9TQo2sGh9">(3) three .csv files</a>, 
        each preloaded with rows of multiple-choice questions with (4) four potential answer options, and the correct answer; 
        a non-relational database was created using 
        <a href="https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/652f113698706805148ab022#/clusters/detail/itec4020a">MongoDB Atlas</a> 
        with the name 'ChatGPT_Evaluation'.  The (3) three .csv files were uploaded into separate collections: 
        'Computer_Security', 'History', and 'Social_Science'.
        <br />
        <br />
        We adopted MongoDB's ODM (Object Data Modelling) library to build a schema for the ChatGPT_Evaluation 
        database which will be routed to via Node.js.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>The Tools: Node.js, Express.js & EJS</h4>
        Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable 
        network applications.  Node.js has a built-in package manager, Node Package Manager (NPM) which 
        was used to allow server-side scripting to perform on a local server.  We created a local server 
        using Express.js.
        <br />
        <br />
        Express.js is a Web Application Framework for Node.js that simplifies server creation, routing, 
        middleware, and more.  We use Express.js in this assignment as the backbone for our web research 
        page and communication routing with the MongoDB database and ChatGPT's AI via RESTful APIs.

        <h4>The Technologies - ChatGPT API</h4>
        Provided a ChatGPT API key, we integrated ChatGPT's
